Project Abstract:
Introduction

Modern supervised ML/DL pipelines gauge efficacy by decreasing the value of a single loss function. However, once trained, they overlook broader design requirements, as inanimate computers lack an ethical understanding the real-world significance of recall. For example, a model trained on a dataset that reports cases associating solely old age with cancer metastasis will produce skewed, feature-bias-laden results that pose a threat to subpopulations. NeutralNet is a novel affixation mechanism that decreases bias and promotes fairness in AI applications by utilizing TensorFlow Constrained Optimization (TFCO) to preemptively make adjustments model parameters prior to output testing.

Design

NeutralNet was constructed with TensorFlow, Keras, and TFCO. A baseline model was trained with an ADAM optimizer on a UCI renal cancer dataset. To create the NeutralNet segment, input/group tensors, contexts, constraints, and the ADAM and Adagrad optimizers were implemented. By way of  utilizing Lagrangian proxy constraints, the overlay enabled loss function differentiability and gradient descent to enforce recall requirements.

Discussion

The unconstrained model harbored harmful feature bias for young CKD-positive patients, as anticipated. NeutralNetâ€™s Lagrangian proxy constraints transformed the parabolic recall decay of the original model to a linear, high recall rate; a fatal, invisible feature bias error was averted. NeuralNet is entirely detachable can pair with modern ML/DL networks to target societal applications of feature bias.

NeutralNet is a novel mechanism that brings human bias assessment to ML and can further be applied to combat skewed diagnoses, social injustice, and false African-American association with high criminal rates.
